# [Sunrise Notes](https://www.sunrisenotes.com/)
This is a notes application built by students for students. What makes this application unique is that it offers the ability to search notes by multiple tags. In otherwords, students can take advantage of set based logic while organizing their notes. Take a look at the __example case__ for more examples on how this is used.

## Production Website

## Example Case
__Problem:__ Suppose Alfred, a student is in three classes. ECON 101, MATH 111 and CHEM 121. Alfred uses Sunrise Notes to store lecture notes, study guides and to do lists for each class.

__Solution:__ Alfred can make a tag for each class and each document type. Now he can perform the following searches to get the following results. Additionally, the real results are color coded for a more understandable experience.

| Alfred's Intent | Search Tags | Resulting Notes |
| ------ |  ------ | ------ |
| Get ECON 101 notes | ECON 101 | All Econ 101 notes |
| Get the MATH 111 to do list | MATH 111, To Do Lists | All MATH 111 notes & to do lists (color coded)  |
| Get all to do lists| To Do Lists | All To Do Lists|
